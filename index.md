## Mission & Values
Build Oahu specializes in kitchens, bathrooms, additions and large renovations. 

From start to finish, we do our job as quickly, efficiently and as clean as possible. 

No job is too small for our customers because we know if we're there for them when their toilet breaks, they will want us to help them when they take on a larger project. 

Our motto is design and build. We walk with our customers through each phase of the design, permit and construction process, because helping them when they need us creates less stress and leads to the high-quality homes they have always dreamed of.

## Employment Policies

### Equal Employment Opportunity
Build Oahu is an equal employment opportunity employer.  We maintain a policy  of  non‐discrimination  against employees  or  job  applicants  on  the  basis  of  race, religion, color, sex, age, national origin, handicap, military status, disability or any other status  or  characteristic  protected  by  applicable  state  laws,  except  where  a  bona  fide occupational qualification applies. 

We will recruit, hire, train and promote persons in all job classifications.  Furthermore, we insure that all personnel programs such as compensation, benefits, transfers, layoffs, return from layoff, company‐sponsored training, and social and recreation programs will be  administered  without  regard  to  race,  religion,  color,  sex,  age,  national  origin, handicap, veteran status, or any other status of condition protected by applicable state law. 

If you have a question about any type of discrimination at work, talk with your immediate supervisor the Operations Manager or the Owner. You will not be punished for asking questions about this. Also, if we find out that anyone was illegally discriminating, that person will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

### Disability Accommodation
It is the policy of Build Oahu to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and The ADA Amendments Act of 2008. 

We will make sure that all individuals with disabilities: 
- Have an equal opportunity to apply for jobs and to work in jobs for which they are qualified; 
- Have an equal opportunity to be promoted once they are working; 
- Have equal access to benefits and privileges of employment that are offered to other employees; and 
- Are not harassed because of their disability. 

We will not ask questions about disabilities or require medical examinations until after we have made someone a conditional job offer. We keep medical records confidential and separate from other personnel files. After making a job offer, we will only ask disability-related questions and conduct medical examinations for everyone in the same job category. 

Once a person with a disability has started working, actual job performance, and not the employee's disability, will be used as an indicator of the employee's ability to do the job. 
Any medical information about applicants or employees will be kept confidential. Information can be confidential even if it contains no medical diagnosis or treatment course and even if it is not generated by a health care professional. 

We will provide reasonable accommodations if a person with a disability needs one in order to apply for a job, perform a job, or enjoy benefits equal to those we offer to other employees. We will not provide an accommodation that poses an undue hardship to Build Oahu. 

Once an accommodation is requested, we will discuss the employee's needs and identify the appropriate reasonable accommodation. We may ask for documentation as to why the requested accommodation is needed.
We will ask questions related to disability and may require a medical examination of an employee whose medical condition appears to be causing performance or safety problems.

ADA (Life-Threatening Illnesses in the Workplace)

Employees with serious  illnesses or injury often wish to continue their normal lives, including work, to the degree that they can. Build Oahu wants to help these employees to work as long as they continue meeting acceptable performance standards. As with other disabilities, we will offer you reasonable accommodations to let you perform the essential functions of your position as long as it doesn't cause undue hardship to Build Oahu. 

Build Oahu also prohibits discrimination or harassment against individuals with a serious illness or injury. Employees are prohibited from any actions or behavior intended to draw attention to, harass or discriminate against an individual with a serious illness or injury. 

You do not have to discuss your serious illness or injury with anyone unless you choose to do so. If you decide to inform your supervisor or the Human Resources Department about your situation, any information that you disclose will be held in the greatest confidence. All employees are prohibited from disclosing the personal health information of another employee. Any medical information which we receive will be kept confidential. 

If you are hospitalized or out of work and wish for us to make other employees aware of your condition, you may notify us in writing and we will put your information on the company bulletin board. Otherwise, the Build Oahu prohibition on the disclosure of personal health information shall apply. No employee may make postings, send interoffice emails or circulate any information about the health status of another employee. 

If you have questions or concerns about life-threatening illnesses, you should contact the Human Resources Department for information and referral to appropriate services and resources.

### Employment At Will
Your relationship with Build Oahu is strictly a voluntary one. If you do not have a specific employment contract or collective bargaining agreement, employment is at-will. This means that you may terminate your employment at any time for any reason, with or without notice. Additionally, Build Oahu  may terminate your employment at any time, for any reason, as long as we do not violate any applicable federal or state law.

This handbook is not a contract or legal document, nor is it an invitation to contract. No one may enter into an employment contract without the signature of the President of the Company.  The provisions in the handbook have been developed at the discretion of management and, except for the policy of employment-at-will, may be amended or cancelled at any time, at the sole discretion of the Company.

These provisions replace all other existing policies and practices and may not be changed or added to without the express written approval of the chief executive officer of the Company.

### Immigration Law Compliance
Build Oahu will employ only United States citizens and those non-United States citizens who are authorized to work in the United States. We will comply with all aspects of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Build Oahu will not discriminate on the basis of national origin or citizenship. 

As a condition of employment, each new employee must complete the Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9 and present documentation establishing identity and substantiating employment eligibility. 

Former employees who are rehired must complete another Form I-9 if the previous I-9 with the Company is more than three years old, or if the original I-9 is not accurate anymore, or if we no longer have the original I-9. If you have questions or want information on the immigration laws, contact the Operations Manager, or the Owner. If you ask questions or want to complain about the immigration law, you will not be punished in any way.

### Evaluation Period of Employment
The first 60 calendar days of full-time employment is an evaluation period for new and rehired employees. During this evaluation period, we will evaluate your work habits and abilities to make sure that you can perform your job satisfactorily. The evaluation period also gives you time to decide if the new job meets your expectations.

If you are absent for a significant amount of time during your evaluation period, the length of the absence will automatically extend the evaluation period. We may also extend the evaluation period if we decide it was not long enough to evaluate your performance. This could happen either during or at the end of the introductory period.
  
You and your immediate  supervisor  share  the  responsibility  for your performance and the further development of your skills.  Therefore, please do not hesitate to discuss any aspect of your job with your supervisor. Communication is key. If you don't know, then ask. If you are not comfortable doing something then don't do it. Ask for help. You are not expected to know how to do everything you are asked to do during your evaluation period, but we do expect you to display a willingness and ability to learn how. 

After you have been employed for 60 days, you will be reviewed by your supervisor. If you have satisfactorily completed the evaluation period, you will be classified as a regular employee and will receive an initial pay increase based on the results of your evaluation. For more information on these and other benefits you receive as an employee of Build Oahu please read the [Benefits Section](#Benefits) 

Employment both before and after the evaluation period is at-will, you or the company may terminate your employment at any time, with or without cause or advance notice. 

[top](#Build-Oahu-Employee-Handbook)
 
### Performance Appraisals
An employee and his/her supervisor should discuss job performance and goals on an informal, day-to-day basis. In addition, supervisors will schedule a meeting with you on or around January 31 and August 1 of each year to discuss your work and goals, identify and correct areas for improvement, and to encourage and recognize your strengths. 

Information  derived  from  the  appraisal  may  be  considered  when  making  decisions affecting  training,  pay,  promotion,  transfer, or  continued  employment. Performance evaluations are not automatically tied to pay increases.

## Productive Work Environment
It is our goal to promote a productive work environment and not to tolerate verbal or physical conduct by any employee that harasses, disrupts, or interferes with another’s work performance or that creates an intimidating, offensive, or hostile environment.  

Employees are expected to maintain a productive work environment that is free from harassing or disruptive activity.  No form of harassment will be tolerated, including harassment for the following reasons: race, national origin, religion, disability, pregnancy, age, military status, or sex. Special attention should be paid to the prohibition of sexual harassment.  

Each employee has a responsibility to keep the workplace free of any form of harassment, and in particular, sexual harassment. No employee is to threaten or insinuate, either explicitly or implicitly, that another employee’s refusal or willingness to submit to sexual advances will affect the employee’s terms or condition of employment.   Other sexually harassing or offensive conduct in the workplace, whether committed by supervisors, 
managers, non‐supervisory employees, or non‐employees, is also prohibited. This conduct includes: 
1. Unwanted physical contact or conduct of any kind, including sexual flirtations, touching, advances, or 
propositions; 
2. Verbal harassment of a sexual nature, such as lewd comments, sexual jokes or references, and 
offensive personal reference; 
3. Demeaning, insulting, intimidating, or sexually suggestive comments about an individual; 
4. The display in the workplace of demeaning, insulting, intimidating, or sexually suggestive objects, pictures, or photographs; 
5. Demeaning, insulting, intimidating, or sexually suggestive written, recorded, or electronically 
transmitted messages. 

Any of the above conduct, or other offensive conduct, directed at individuals because of their race, sex, national origin, religion, disability, pregnancy, age, or military status is prohibited. 

Any employee who believes that a supervisor’s, other employee’s or non‐employee’s actions or words constitute unwelcome harassment has a responsibility to report or complain about the situation as soon as possible. The report or compliant should be made to the Supervisor or to the or next level supervisor or the company owner if the complaint involves the Supervisor.  

Any complaint of harassment will be handled and investigated.  All complaints of harassment will be investigated promptly and in as impartial and confidential a manner as possible. Employees are required to cooperate in any investigation.  A timely resolution of each complaint should be reached and communicated to the parties involved.  Any employee who is found to have violated the harassment policy will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Management prohibits any form of retaliation against employees for bringing bona fide complaints or providing information about harassment.

## Wages & Benefits

[top](#Build-Oahu-Employee-Handbook)

## Attendance & Punctuality

We expect Build Oahu employees to arrive at work before you are scheduled to start and be productively engaged in the company business by the scheduled start time. If you cannot come to work or you will be late, you must notify your Supervisor prior to your scheduled start time, unless in extenuating circumstances. You must request all time off in advance and submit it in writing, as outlined in this section and the section on [Leave](#Leave), except in the case of an unexpected illness.

Unplanned absences can disrupt work, inconvenience other employees, and affect productivity. All unapproved absences will be noted in the employee's personnel file. Excessive absences (including leaving work early) or tardiness, including for illness or personal reasons, will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 

[top](#Build-Oahu-Employee-Handbook)

## Leave

At this time Build Oahu does not provide any accrued paid time off, such as vacation or sick leave to our employees. 

You are free to take unpaid time off for reasons like vacation, medical appointments, personal or family reasons, or illness provided your absences are well coordinated with your supervisor and the time spent away from work or the number of occurances does not result in excessive absence as outlined in the section on [Attendance & Punctuality](#Attendance-&-Punctuality)   

All leave should be requested in writing via email to your supervisor and your supervisor must provide an affirmative response in writing in order for your request to be considered an approved absense. 

Vacation days should be requested a minimum of two weeks in advance. Time off for medical appointments, personal or family reasons should be requested as far in advance as possible, preferably a week or more. If unexpected illness or family emergencies occur, please notify your supervisor as soon as you realize you will need to take time off from work.

### Jury Duty

### Holidays


## Recording Your Time 

All Build Oahu employees are given a key fob they use to clock in and out of each job site using a system called TSheets. It is mandatory that you clock in and clock out of the specific jobsite where you are located, including clocking in and out for lunch.  If you leave the  facility  or  job  site  for  non‐business  reasons you must clock out.  Failure  to  do  any  of  the  above  will  result  in disciplinary  action  up  to  and  including  termination  and  possible  discrepancies  in  the amount  of  your  compensation.  

[top](#Build-Oahu-Employee-Handbook)

## Overtime 
Overtime work must be approved in advance by the Owner. On occasion, Build Oahu employees must work overtime in order to achieve the quality of work for our customers that reflects our mission and values. If directed, you are expected to work necessary overtime during these occasions. Full-time employees will  receive  time  and  one‐half  pay  for  time worked  exceeding  40  hours  in  any  given workweek. Temporary employees do not receive overtime. 

There may be operations that require you to work at night. Work outside of normal work hours does not automatically qualify as overtime pay. If you are asked to work at night, but your total hours worked for that workweek is less than or equal to 40 hours you will not receive overtime pay.  

Your supervisor will inform you of the need to work overtime hours in a timely manner with as much lead time as possible. 

[top](#Build-Oahu-Employee-Handbook)

## Hours of Operation 
The  normal  hours  of  operation  for  all  employees  are  from  7:30  am  to  4:30 pm,  Monday 
through Friday.   

We expect you to be at the jobsite or as directed at the beginning of your shift and stay on the 
clock until the end of the workday or the end of your shift.  Earlier or later hours may be required at times and there may be coordination calls that need to occur prior to or after your shift. The  possibility  of 
working  overtime  above  scheduled  hours  (including  weekend  hours)  will  always  be 
present and considered mandatory when the workload is excessive. For more information on overtime hours see the section of this handbook on [overtime](#Overtime).

[top](#Build-Oahu-Employee-Handbook)

## Pay Date 
The  workweek  for  payroll  purposes  starts  on  Friday and ends  the  following  Thursday. 
The pay period is bi‐weekly, meaning you will receive payment for two workweeks at a 
time.  The pay date is the second Friday after the pay period ends.  For example, the pay 
date  of  Friday  December  23,  2016  covers  the  period  of  Friday  December  2,  2016 
through  Thursday  December  15,  2016.    Payday  is  every  other  Friday  through  direct 
deposit only.   The pay date will not be adjusted for any reasons, to include scheduled 
vacations.    

Your pay statement will be emailed to you at the email address you provide, and will list 
your  gross  pay  and  itemized  deductions  for  all  time  worked  through  the  preceding 
payroll  week.    If  you  discover  a  mistake  on  your  pay  statement,  notify  the  Office 
Manager as soon as you notice the mistake.
